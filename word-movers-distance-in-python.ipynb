    "In document classification and other natural language processing applications, having a good measure of the similarity of two texts can be a valuable building block.   Ideally, such a measure would capture semantic information.  Cosine similarity on bag-of-words vectors is known to do well in practice, but it inherently cannot capture when documents say the same thing in completely different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for example, two headlines:\n",
    "\n",
    " * *Obama speaks to the media in Illinois*\n",
    " * *The President greets the press in Chicago*\n",
    "\n",
    "These have no content words in common, so according to most bag of words--based metrics, their distance would be maximal.  (For such applications, you probably don't want to count stopwords such as *the* and *in*, which don't truly signal semantic similarity.)\n",

    "WMD adapts the [earth mover's distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance) to the space of documents: the distance between two texts is given by the total amount of \"mass\" needed to move the words from one side into the other, multiplied by the distance the words need to move. So, starting from a measure of the distance between different words, we can get a principled document-level distance. Here is a visualisation of the idea, from the ICML slides:\n",

    "The key ingredient in WMD is a good distance measure between words.  Dense representations of words, also known by the trendier name \"word embeddings\" (because \"distributed word representations\" didn't stick), do the trick here.  We could train the embeddings ourselves, but for meaningful results we would need tons of documents, and that might take a while. So let's just use the ones from the [`word2vec`](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) team. [(download link)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing)"

Simply wrapping `WordMoversKNN` in a `GridSearchCV` would be rather expensive because of all the distances that would need to be recomputed for every value of `n_neighbors`. So we introduce **`WordMoversKNNCV`**, which, when fitted, performs *cross-validation* to find the best value of `n_neighbors` (under any given evaluation metric), while only computing the WMD once per fold, and only across folds (saving `n_folds * fold_size ** 2` evaluations)."

Given enough data, WMD can probably improve this margin, especially using something like metric learning on top.\n",
